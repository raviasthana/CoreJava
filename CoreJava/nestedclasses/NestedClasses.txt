Nested Classes
==============
There are 4 flavours of nested/inner classes

1) Static member classes
2) Member Classes
3) Local Classes
4) Anonymous Classes

Static member class
-------------------
Static member class is called a "Nested Class", while other 3 flavours are called an "Inner Class".

Static member class is a way of 'grouping' classes together. Java of-course doesn't allow you to create
top-level static classes; only nested static classes.

Static member class acts like an entirely separate class, which just happens to be accessed via the
outer/enclosing class. You DON'T need an instance of the outer class to created an object of static 
member class. Static member class can access static data members of enclosing class, or call static
methods, for that matter.

Member class
------------
Member class is a also defined as a member of a class. Unlike the static variety, the member class
is "instance specific" (requires object of enclosing class to create its instance). Member class
has access to any and all methods and members, even the parents(enclosing class) 'this' reference.

Local class
-----------
Local classes are declared 'within a block' of code and are visible ONLY within that block, just
as any other method variable. A local class can only access final variables (effectively final
variables in java8) declared within enclosing block.

Anonymous class
---------------
Anonymous class 'is a Local class' that has no name. 

Advantage of nested/inner classes
=================================
Advantage of inner classes can be divided into three categories.

a) An Object Oriented Advantage
b) An Organisational Advantage
c) A call-back Advantage

The object-oriented advantage
-----------------------------
An important(may be most important) feature of the inner class is that it allows you to turn things into 
objects that you normally wouldn't turn into objects. This allows code to be even more object-oriented
than it would be without inner classes.

Let's look at the member class. Since its instance is a member of its parent instance, it has access to 
every member and method in the parent. At first glance, this might not seem like much; we already have that
sort of access from within a method in the parent class. However, the member class allows us to take logic 
out of the parent and objectify it. For example, a tree class may have a method and many helper methods 
that perform a search or walk of the tree. From an object-oriented point of view, the tree is a tree, 
not a search algorithm. However, you need intimate knowledge of the tree's data structures to accomplish 
a search.

An inner class allows us to remove that logic and place it into its own class. So from an object-oriented 
point of view, we've taken functionality out of where it doesn't belong and have put it into its own class.
Through the use of an inner class, we have successfully decoupled the search algorithm from the tree. 
Now, to change the search algorithm, we can simply swap in a new class. 
This opens up our code to many of the advantages provided by object-oriented techniques.

The organizational advantage
----------------------------
Object-oriented design isn't everyone's thing, but luckily, inner classes provide more. 
From an organizational point of view, inner classes allow us to further organize our package structure 
through the use of namespaces. Instead of dumping everything in a flat package, classes can be further 
nested within classes. Explicitly, without inner classes, we were limited to the following hierarchy 
structure:

package1
   class 1
      class 2
      ...
      class n
...
package n

With inner classes we can do the following:

package 1
   class 1
   class 2
      class 1
      class 2
      ...
      class n

Used carefully, inner classes can provide a structural hierarchy that more naturally fits your classes.

The callback advantage
-----------------------
Inner member classes and anonymous classes both provide a convenient method for defining callbacks. 
The most obvious example relates to GUI code. However, the application of the callback can extend to 
many domains.

Most Java GUIs have some kind of component that instigates an actionPerformed() method call. 
Unfortunately, most developers simply have their main window implement ActionListener. As a result, all 
components share the same actionPerformed() method. To figure out which component performed the action, 
there is normally a giant, ugly switch in the actionPerformed() method.

Here's an example of a monolithic implementation:

public class SomeGUI extends JFrame implements ActionListener
{
   protected JButton button1;
   protected JButton button2;
   ...
   protected JButton buttonN;
   public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
   {
      if(e.getSource()==button1)
      {
         // do something
         }
      else if(e.getSource()==button2)
      {
         ... you get the picture
         
Whenever you see switches or large if/if else blocks, loud alarm bells should begin to ring in your mind. 
In general, such constructs are bad object-oriented design since a change in one section of the code may 
require a corresponding change in the switch statement. Inner member classes and anonymous classes allow 
us to get away from the switched actionPerformed() method.

Instead, we can define an inner class that implements ActionListener for each component to which we want 
to listen. That may result in many inner classes. However, we can avoid large switch statements and have 
the added bonus of encapsulating our action logic. Moreover, that approach may improve performance. 
In a switch where there are n comparisons, we can expect n/2 comparisons in the average case. 
Inner classes allow us to set up a 1:1 correspondence between the action performer and the action listener.
In a large GUI, such optimizations can make a substantial impact on performance. An anonymous approach 
may look like this:

public class SomeGUI extends JFrame
{
   ... button member declarations ...
   protected void buildGUI()
   {
      button1 = new JButton();
      button2 = new JButton();
      ...
      button1.addActionListener(
         new java.awt.event.ActionListener()
         {
            public void actionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent e)
            {
               // do something
            }
         }
      );
      
      .. repeat for each button
      
Using inner member classes, the same program would look like this:

public class SomeGUI extends JFrame
{
   ... button member declarations
   // inner class definitions
   class Button1Handler implements ActionListener
   {
      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
   {
         // do something
      }
   }
   
   ... define an inner member class for each button
   
   protected void buildGUI()
   {
      // initialize the buttons
      button1 = new JButton();
      button2 = new JButton();
      ...
      // register an inner class action listener instance
      // for each button
      button1.addActionListener(new Button1Handler());
      .. repeat for each button
      
Since inner classes have access to everything in the parent, we can move any logic that would have 
appeared in a monolithic actionPerformed() implementation to an inner class.

I prefer to use member classes as callbacks. However, that is a matter of personal preference. 
I just feel that too many anonymous classes clutter code. I also feel that anonymous classes can become 
unwieldy if they are larger than one or two lines.

Disadvantages?
--------------
As with anything else, you have to take the good with the bad. Inner classes have their disadvantages. 
From a maintenance point of view, inexperienced Java developers may find the inner class difficult to 
understand. The use of inner classes will also increase the total number of classes in your code. 

Some under the hood details
===========================
When you create an instance of an anonymous inner class, any variables which are used within that class 
have their values copied in via the auto-generated constructor. This avoids the compiler having to 
auto-generate various extra types to hold the logical state of the "local variables", as for example 
the C# compiler does(When C# captures a variable in an anonymous function, it really captures the variable
- the closure can update the variable in a way which is seen by the main body of the method, 
and vice versa.)

As the value has been copied into the instance of the anonymous inner class, it would look odd if 
the variable could be modified by the rest of the method - you could have code which appeared to 
be working with an out-of-date variable (because that's effectively what would be happening. 
You'd be working with a copy taken at a different time). Likewise if you could make changes within 
the anonymous inner class, developers might expect those changes to be visible within the body of 
the enclosing method.

Making the variable final removes all these possibilities - as the value can't be changed at all, 
you don't need to worry about whether such changes will be visible. The only ways to allow the 
method and the anonymous inner class see each other's changes is to use a mutable type of some 
description. This could be the enclosing class itself, an array, a mutable wrapper type. 
Anything like that. Basically it's a bit like communicating between one method and another, 
changes made to the parameters of one method aren't seen by its caller, but changes made to the 
objects referred to by the parameters are seen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Local classes can most definitely reference instance variables. The reason they cannot reference 
non final local variables is because the local class instance can remain in memory after the method returns.
When the method returns the local variables go out of scope, so a copy of them is needed. 
If the variables weren’t final then the copy of the variable in the method could change, while the copy 
in the local class didn’t, so they’d be out of synch.

Anonymous inner classes require final variables because of the way they are implemented in Java. 
An anonymous inner class (AIC) uses local variables by creating a private instance field which holds a copy 
of the value of the local variable. The inner class isn’t actually using the local variable, but a copy. 
It should be fairly obvious at this point that a “Bad Thing”™ can happen if either the original value or 
the copied value changes; there will be some unexpected data synchronisation problems. 
In order to prevent this kind of problem, Java requires you to mark local variables that will be used by 
the AIC as final (i.e., unchangeable). This guarantees that the inner class’ copies of local variables 
will always match the actual values.
